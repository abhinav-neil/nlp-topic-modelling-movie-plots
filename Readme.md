# NLP and Topic Modelling on Movie Plots

## A notebook for NLP on the Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset. We illustrate the following:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and wordclouds
- NLP with spacy: tokenization, lemmatization, parts-of-speech (PoS) tagging, Dependency Parsing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) using spacy
- Vectorization with Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF and spaCy using scikit-learn
- Topic modelling: Extract major themes (topics) from plots using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using gensim
- Visualization of topic clusters with pyLDAvis
